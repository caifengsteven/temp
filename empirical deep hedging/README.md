# Empirical Deep Hedging Strategy

This project implements an empirical deep hedging strategy using Bloomberg data and Python. The strategy uses deep learning techniques to optimize hedging ratios for financial instruments.

## Overview

Deep hedging is a modern approach to financial risk management that uses deep learning to optimize hedging strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on analytical solutions from mathematical models, deep hedging learns optimal hedging strategies directly from market data.

This implementation:
1. Connects to Bloomberg API to fetch market data
2. Implements multiple hedging strategies:
   - Beta-based hedging
   - Minimum variance hedging
   - Deep learning-based hedging using LSTM neural networks
3. Provides backtesting functionality to evaluate strategy performance
4. Visualizes results and calculates performance metrics

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Bloomberg Terminal with API access
- Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - tensorflow
  - blpapi (Bloomberg API)
  - xbbg (Bloomberg API wrapper)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from bloomberg_deep_hedging import BloombergDataFetcher, HedgingStrategy

# Initialize Bloomberg data fetcher
data_fetcher = BloombergDataFetcher()

# Initialize hedging strategy
strategy = HedgingStrategy(data_fetcher)

# Backtest the strategy
results = strategy.backtest(
    asset_ticker='SPY US Equity',
    hedge_ticker='SH US Equity',
    start_date='2020-01-01',
    end_date='2023-12-31',
    rebalance_freq='W',  # Weekly rebalancing
    method='beta'  # Use beta-based hedging
)

# Plot results
strategy.plot_results(results)
```

### Using Deep Learning Model

```python
from bloomberg_deep_hedging import BloombergDataFetcher, DeepHedgingModel, HedgingStrategy

# Initialize Bloomberg data fetcher
data_fetcher = BloombergDataFetcher()

# Initialize deep learning model
model = DeepHedgingModel(lookback_period=10, features=5)

# Train the model (simplified example)
# In practice, you would prepare your data and train the model properly
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = prepare_your_data()
model.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=50)

# Initialize hedging strategy with the trained model
strategy = HedgingStrategy(data_fetcher, model)

# Backtest the strategy using deep learning
results = strategy.backtest(
    asset_ticker='SPY US Equity',
    hedge_ticker='SH US Equity',
    start_date='2020-01-01',
    end_date='2023-12-31',
    rebalance_freq='W',
    method='deep_learning'
)

# Plot results
strategy.plot_results(results)
```

## Methodology

### Beta-Based Hedging

This method calculates the hedge ratio based on the beta of the asset relative to the hedging instrument. Beta represents the sensitivity of the asset's returns to the hedging instrument's returns.

### Minimum Variance Hedging

This method aims to minimize the variance of the hedged portfolio by finding the optimal hedge ratio that minimizes the overall risk.

### Deep Learning-Based Hedging

This method uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to learn the optimal hedge ratio based on historical market data. The model takes into account multiple features such as price, volatility, and volume to predict the optimal hedge ratio.

## Performance Metrics

The strategy calculates the following performance metrics:
- Annualized Return
- Annualized Volatility
- Sharpe Ratio

## Bloomberg API Integration

The strategy uses the Bloomberg API to fetch market data. If the Bloomberg API is not available, the strategy will use mock data for testing purposes.
